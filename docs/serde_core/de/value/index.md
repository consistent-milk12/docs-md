# Module `value`

Building blocks for deserializing basic values using the `IntoDeserializer`
trait.

```edition2021
use serde::de::{value, Deserialize, IntoDeserializer};
use serde_derive::Deserialize;
use std::str::FromStr;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
enum Setting {
    On,
    Off,
}

impl FromStr for Setting {
    type Err = value::Error;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        Self::deserialize(s.into_deserializer())
    }
}
