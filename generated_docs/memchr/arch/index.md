# Module `arch`

A module with low-level architecture dependent routines.

These routines are useful as primitives for tasks not covered by the higher
level crate API.

## Quick Reference

| Item | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [`all`](#all) | mod | Contains architecture independent routines. |
| [`generic`](#generic) | mod | This module defines "generic" routines that can be specialized to specific architectures. |
| [`x86_64`](#x86_64) | mod | Vector algorithms for the `x86_64` target. |
